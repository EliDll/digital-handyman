# Digital Handyman (Sebastian Pellizzari, Fabian Aster, Elias Dellago)

With Digital Handyman, we aim to improve and simplify the process of DIY ("do-it-yourself") projects by implementing a variety of virtual planning tools that are always and literally right at your fingertips. These tools offer significant enhancements over conventional tools when it comes to convenience and physical limitations. Our toolbox includes a 3D Pen, which is easily erasable without leaving any marks on physical surfaces; a measuring Tape/Spirit Level, capable of measuring around corners and expanding to any size; and a virtual Laser pointer/plane, which enables precise alignment in 3D space. With these augmented tools, users will have all the necessary planning equipment to realize their DIY projects. This virtual toolbox simplifies the entire DIY process, not only by saving time, space and money, but also by improving accuracy and precision, ensuring every project is completed to the highest standard.
